        This week I learned about the many properties of css. There is a very useful Youtube
        video which explains some of the key importances of integrating css into html code. 
        The link is attached <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSnugnQYiI">HERE.</a>
   </p>
    <p>
        To display the css property being implemented in html code, I set the color of the <body>
        to be red, as it is the main theme color of youtube.
