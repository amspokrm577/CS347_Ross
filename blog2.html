        I did research on attaching links to text. For example, after visiting
        w3 schools I found that if a users clicks <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">HERE</a>
        they would be redirected to the w3 schools home page.

        This step is not only important for helping setup all of my blog posts, but the 
        website is a very useful resource for beginner -> novice programmers who either 
        need to learn new information or reinforce previously retained information.
